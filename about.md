I am an IBM Senior AI Engineer who specializes in the Watson Data and AI services. I work primarily by leveraging technical skills build cloud-native solutions for customers.

Before joining IBM I worked for [NASA's Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility](http://www.csbf.nasa.gov) as a Software Engineering Intern. While there I focused on the Aquila display program which was used to display flight data in real-time from payloads. I'm also a former [High School Aerospace Scholar](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/stem/High_School_Aerospace_Scholars.html) and [Community College Aerospace Scholar](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/stem/NASA_Community_College_Aerospace_Scholars.html)! Because I enjoy staying busy, I participated in the [Distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates](https://cra.org/cra-wp/dreu/) program at through the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov) at The University of Alabama during the summer of 2015 where I researched pervasive systems for elder care. You can read about my experience in [this article](https://cra.org/profiles-women-computing-morgan-carroll/) from the Computing Research Association for Women or on [my blog from that summer](https://mcarroll15.weebly.com/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (math minor, woot) from [The University of Texas at Tyler](http://www.uttyler.edu) shortly after that. Again because I evidently do not enjoy free time, I decided to begin working towards my Master's degree in Computer Science and as of 2020, I have graduated from [Texas State University's](https://www.txstate.edu/) Computer Science graduate program!

Outside of work, I am an East Texas native (8th generation) but have lived in Austin for 4 years. My interests include gaming, astronomy, reading, kayaking, women's rights, spending time with my dogs, and trying new restaurants around Austin. Until recently I owned a motorcycle and still consider it to be one of my favorite hobbies.
