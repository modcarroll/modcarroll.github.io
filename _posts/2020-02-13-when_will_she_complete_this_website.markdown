Will she ever actually finish her website?

Between work and graduate school, it's difficult to find time to actually complete my website. On top of that, I can never decide between themes. Should I go with something professional and crisp? Maybe something more representative of my interests, like a tiled corgi butt background. Either way, one of my goals for 2020 is to increase my eminence, so expect more content shortly. In the meantime, keep up with what I'm doing on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morganlanglais/) and [GitHub](http://www.github.com/modlanglais).
